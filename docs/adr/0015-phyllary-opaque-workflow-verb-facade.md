# Phyllary: an opaque workflow-verb facade owns the public workflow contract

Workflow mechanism (claim atomicity, sync discipline, finish sequencing) lived in seed prose and
auto-memories that agents re-read, re-obey, and eventually skip (dotfiles-b6r); fixes landed as
more prose (y7m, ys5, the skip-worktree/dirty-checkout memory cluster). We move every menial,
deterministic step behind **`phyllary`** — a single dispatcher in repo `bin/`, stowed like the `bd`
shim — and the agent speaks workflow verbs. The split is **judgment vs paperwork**: the agent
decides *which* verb and authors anything requiring judgment (PR bodies, promotion titles, return
reasons); the phyllary executes mechanism exactly, in code that cannot drift from itself.

The durable decision is the **facade contract**, not ownership of every primitive forever. Phyllary is
allowed — expected — to orchestrate existing substrates (`bd`, `gh`, git refs, GitHub Actions,
branch protection) and to swap or delegate those substrates later. What bundles and agents depend
on is the verb grammar, exit/output contracts, and idempotent reconciliation behaviour.

This clarification is deliberately made before the dotfiles cutover: the concurrent Umbel overhaul
may reorganise bundle application, but it must not accidentally make bundles the owners of Phyllary's
state machine or make Phyllary depend on Umbel internals.

## Boundary contract

### Phyllary public contract

The public contract is the `phyllary` CLI: its verb roster, argument shapes, exit-code taxonomy,
prescriptive output, `.phyllary` marker interpretation, and the idempotency promised by `doctor`,
`claim`, `release`, `return`, `submit`, `gate`, `finish`, `sync`, and `glean`. Tests assert this
contract at the command boundary. Callers may rely on successful mutations being self-verified
before a success line is printed, and on repeated reconciliation converging rather than duplicating
work.

The public `bin/phyllary` launcher invokes the self-contained, stdlib-only Python 3.11+
implementation. It remains the compatibility boundary: callers invoke the same executable and rely
on the same verb grammar, exit-code taxonomy, prescriptive output, manifest handling, mutation
verification, delivery-gate behaviour, and reconciliation semantics. Compatibility is proven at the
public CLI contract, especially command-boundary tests, not by preserving implementation internals.

### Umbel bundle contract

Umbel bundles are **clients of Phyllary**, not generators of Phyllary. A bundle may:

- include Phyllary-facing operating prose (short seed text, session loop, keys);
- install a thin SessionStart hook that injects those rules and kicks `phyllary glean`;
- choose which skills compose around the Phyllary loop;
- tell the operator to run `phyllary doctor` when setup is missing.

A bundle must not:

- parse or write backend state directly (`bd`, GitHub issue labels, claim branches) when a Phyllary
  verb exists;
- parse `.phyllary` itself instead of calling Phyllary;
- synthesize a different `phyllary` implementation during bundle application;
- encode branch/worktree/finish mechanics in seed prose as a parallel workflow.

Umbel apply remains idempotent over bundle pins, generated hook config, and injected text. Per-repo
workflow state (`.phyllary`, open claims, worktrees, PRs, transcript watermarks) is Phyllary/repo state,
not bundle state. Rollback is therefore re-pinning the old bundle generation; it must not require
rewinding Phyllary's already-reconciled operational state.

### Manifest contract

`.phyllary` is the repo-local manifest v0 owned by the Phyllary/repo boundary (ADR 0017). Bundles may
assume Phyllary can dispatch once `phyllary doctor` is green; they do not own the marker schema. Schema
changes are handled as Phyllary compatibility work: accept old valid manifests, diagnose ambiguous
ones, and have `doctor` prescribe or perform safe migrations.

### Change budget

Small changes: seed wording, bundle composition, skill lists, prompt text, and hook text that still
calls the same Phyllary verbs.

Medium changes: adding manifest keys, changing labels/states behind an existing verb, changing PR
body proof schema, or adding a backend binding while preserving the verb contract.

Large changes: changing the claim lock/worktree model, removing PRs as the convergence point,
changing merge semantics in a way that invalidates finish's PR-state model, or changing the public
verb grammar. Large changes require a focused grill before delivery resumes.

## Decision

- **Phyllary is a facade over primitives, not a new substrate monopoly.** The workflow needed a stable
  command boundary because prose/config discipline was the failing layer; it did not require
  reimplementing every underlying capability. Existing primitives remain first-choice internals
  where they match the contract.
- **Implementation language is not the contract.** The CLI contract above survives the completed
  stdlib-only Python 3.11+ port. The public command remains the launcher and contract boundary.
- **The Work graph adapter is the Python backend seam.** Command handlers ask it for Work graph and
  Backlog operations rather than encoding backend edge shapes or pickability. The adapter owns the
  ready/pickable/waiting split, including the rule that a ready parent with an open direct child is
  not pickable. It computes the full bd-backed graph from an unlimited snapshot, avoiding serial
  per-candidate detail calls. Remaining Python-port slices use this adapter for Work state,
  graph mutations, and delivery lifecycle transitions instead of adding command-local bd logic.
- **Umbel bundles consume Phyllary; they do not own it.** The bundle layer provides operating rules and
  hook wiring. Phyllary owns workflow mechanism and repo-local state.
- **Grammar is noun-scoped by collection (place)**: `inbox` (refinement views over non-ready work)
  and `backlog` (refinement-complete ready work). Ready and pickable are intentionally split:
  `inbox ready` records that refinement is complete, while backlog verbs compute whether the Work
  graph makes that unit claimable/resolvable now. Object-type nouns break under promote=flow;
  ID-shape dispatch couples to backend token formats — both rejected in the session-1 stress test
  (epic dotfiles-dft).
- **Verb roster**: `capture "<title>" [--stdin|--type <type>|--impediment|--parent <id>|--blocked-by <id>]`;
  `inbox list|show|dups|ready|drop|pregrill|children|frontier|blockers|blocked|parent|dep|claim|release|note|update|resolve`;
  `backlog next|show|waiting|claim|release|resolve|return|proof|submit|gate|finish`; `sync`; `doctor`; `glean`.
- **Opacity (hard ban, layered)**: skills, bundles, hooks, seeds, and injected instructions never
  name beads/`bd` — the backing store is the phyllary's private business. Agent *runtime* discovery of
  `bd` is tolerated (reads harmless; writes self-punishing — they reintroduce solved bugs like the
  stale close ADR 0013 fixed) and signals a missing verb (an Impediment). The unattended tier will
  make the ban structural via the permission allowlist (dotfiles-220). Raw `bd` grooming
  (`dep`/`update`/`epic`) stays legal only in operator docs and live human sessions; the first
  *skill* needing grooming vocabulary is the trigger to mint the phyllary verb.
- **One keyless binary, four callers**: agent in attended session; agent in job (phyllary detects job
  context itself — absorbs the BD_SHIM_SYNC seed clauses); **no agent at all** — the
  authorship-free verbs (`sync`, `doctor`) are schedulable as a plain systemd timer, zero tokens;
  human terminal (`phyllary backlog next` is `nextdelivery`'s successor as a first-class human
  surface; `--explain` prints underlying commands + ADR pointer).
- **Three keys, zero verb ACLs** — autonomy is dialed at boundaries the human controls, never in
  phyllary code: (K1) merge key = review-required branch protection (ADR 0016); (K2) initiation key =
  the human starts sessions; (K3) in-session key = harness permission allowlist (reads, `capture`,
  `claim` free; `submit`/`finish` prompt-gated initially).
- **Three loops, three owners**: inner (red check → fix → push → `finish`) agent-owned in-session;
  session loop (claim → build → submit → finish) owned by the bundle's operating rules; outer loop
  (launching unattended sessions) **deferred to a future epic** — this epic is attended-first,
  unattended-ready.
- **Hook roster = one hook**: SessionStart (seed-inject + kick `phyllary glean`). A Stop-hook claim
  guard was rejected (fires every turn mid-build; no honest mount point) — the `sync` sweep is the
  sole abandonment net. A SessionEnd glean hook was rejected (doesn't fire on crashes/kills —
  leaky exactly on messy sessions).
- **`phyllary glean` is a watermark sweep**: per-transcript-file line-offset watermark (offsets, not
  timestamps: exactly-once, no gaps), spawns the judgment fork per unharvested chunk, advances the
  watermark only after captures file successfully, `flock`-guarded single instance, fully async.
  Cursor state in `~/.local/state/phyllary/`.
- **Reconciler (`finish`/`sync`)**: one stateless function, two schedulers — finish-eager as the
  delivery session's last act, sync-sweep over all open claims (absorbs dotfiles-dnq stale-claim
  reclaim). **The sweep never authors** — it executes authorship-free phases and files reports for
  judgment-needing states. `finish` is non-blocking by default (`--watch` opt-in wraps
  `gh pr checks --watch`); it detects merge via **PR state only, never ancestry** (squash orphans
  branch commits). `submit` is once per unit; iteration repeats `finish`.
- **Merge method = squash**: one unit = one PR = one commit, unit id in the subject, criteria
  evidence in the body — `git log` is the delivery record glean audits.
- **Offline claim = attended-only degraded mode**: proceed with a quantified LOCAL-ONLY warning;
  the canonical branch is the CAS at reconnect (second push rejected → collision detected, never
  silent). Job contexts refuse offline claims.
- **Operational contracts (every verb, asserted verbatim in bats — including the failure paths).**
  Surfaced by the small-model delivery experiment on unit dotfiles-dft.1 (History), where two
  independent implementations both passed all seven acceptance criteria yet diverged on behaviours
  the criteria never pinned — the signature of an underspecified contract, not a coding slip:
  - **Exit-code taxonomy, one meaning each**: `0` success; `1` `doctor` found problems (below);
    `2` usage error / unknown verb / bad-or-missing id (roster or corrected invocation printed);
    `3` a known verb not implemented in this generation; `4` `.phyllary` unresolvable (missing /
    invalid / not in a git repo); `5` a backend command (`bd`/`gh`) failed or a mutation could not
    be confirmed; `6` a delivery-gate ran successfully and found one or more failed proof classes.
    Dispatch distinguishes unknown (`2`) from not-yet-implemented (`3`) — a grammar
    error is not a generation gap; and a broken backend (`5`) from a caller who named a
    non-existent unit (`2`) — "the tracker is down" is not "you passed a bad id". `1` is scoped to
    `doctor`'s health check; every other verb signals operational failure through `5`, never `1`.
  - **`doctor` is a health check, not a diagnostic that always succeeds**: it exits `0` iff every
    check passes and non-zero (`1`) if any fails. This is the contract the zero-token systemd-timer
    caller depends on — a timer can only alert on a non-zero exit; a `doctor` that always exits `0`
    is silent on exactly the failures it exists to catch.
  - **Mutations self-verify before reporting success**: any state-changing action (`doctor --fix`
    writing `.phyllary`, `claim` creating the branch/worktree, `capture` filing) confirms its effect
    landed before printing a success line, and on failure exits non-zero with a prescriptive
    message — it never prints `[ ok ]` / "written" over a failed write. A false success dead-ends
    the dispatch → `doctor` → dispatch recovery loop.
  - **Error text is prompt engineering**: every refusal prescribes the next verb, names the
    resolved path where one is at issue, and (for usage errors) shows the corrected invocation.
    Printed output is load-bearing — the agent's next action follows it.
  - **Output discipline**: 16-color ANSI only (30–37 / 90–97, bold/reset; never `38;5` / `38;2`).
    Colour is suppressed when the stream is not a TTY or `NO_COLOR` is set — the refusal / roster /
    `doctor` strings are parsed downstream and must never carry escape sequences into a pipe or log.

## Considered options

- **Adopt beads formulas/molecules or Gas Town** (verified: local `bd` 1.0.4 ships
  `formula`/`cook`/`mol`/`gate`/`merge-slot`; zero formulas in use) — rejected: formulas define the
  *shape of work* (bead-DAG templates), not mechanism; Gas Town is a multi-agent runtime whose
  Refinery replaces the trust fabric with its own merge queue, killing the gh backlog dispatch and
  the branch-protection gate bet. Steals taken instead: `bd ready` ≈ private `backlog next`;
  `bd --readonly` wraps phyllary read verbs (structural fork read-only); `bd gate`/`merge-slot` noted
  as future serialization primitives. Re-evaluate Gas Town only if the end-state becomes
  multi-agent fleets; opacity keeps `gt` adoptable as a binding later.
- **Five top-level commands instead of a dispatcher** — rejected: `sync`/`doctor` are too generic
  for PATH; `--explain` and doctor version-parity want one entry point.
- **Umbel-derived or flow-family names** — rejected: umbel is a delivery mechanism, not a sibling
  project; `deskflow` collides with the Synergy fork; "task"/"workflow" pollute agent priors
  (harness Task tools, `gh workflow`). `phyllary` is the English word fusing desk + menial labor.
- **Role→backend manifest now** — deferred until a third binding exists; dispatch is two hardcoded
  presets riding the `.phyllary` marker (ADR 0017). Interface now, generality lazily (ADR 0010).

## Consequences

- **The bundle generation is re-authored, not migrated**: new `phyllary-discovery`,
  `phyllary-delivery-base`, `phyllary-delivery-superpowers` speak phyllary from birth; the old generation
  (three workflow manifests + personal variants, `delivery-base-ruleset` hook, both tier seeds,
  presort skill) is **frozen as-is** and retired later. Freeze boundary is wording, not tooling —
  wording-neutral tools (grill-with-docs, plannotator, tuidriver, glean mechanics) are shared.
  Cutover is per-repo re-pin; rollback is re-pinning the old bundle.
- Pre-sort's successor is decision-free with one write verb (`inbox pregrill`, ADR 0016); the
  inbox noun definition (open minus `stage:ready`) moves from skill prose into phyllary code. The Work
  graph can span inbox and backlog: `capture --parent` may target a non-closed promoted parent, and
  `backlog waiting` shows ready items held out of `backlog next` by open blockers or open children.
- `nextdelivery` and its dead `umbel adopt` hint dissolve (`phyllary backlog next` / `phyllary doctor`);
  `land` and the dirty-shared-checkout hazard class dissolve with worktree-per-claim; the
  delivery-finish memory cluster (user-pushes-main, worktree-discard, skip-worktree, dirty-checkout)
  retires — enforced by structure instead of remembered (dotfiles-w0x).
- `CLAUDE.md`'s "issues live in beads" line is Layer-1 text and becomes phyllary wording;
  `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` remains the one operator doc allowed to name beads.

## History

- 2026-08-05: The Python implementation assumed every public verb path after the complete
  Refinement/delivery soak. The legacy Bash implementation and force-legacy override were removed;
  the command-boundary and Python suites now cover the retained public contract.
- 2026-07-25: Python backend clarification added for dotfiles-9urv.17. Work graph invariants and
  substrate-specific graph operations live behind the Work graph adapter seam; remaining port
  slices use that seam as their backend boundary.
- 2026-07-23: Python-port clarification added for epic dotfiles-9urv. Phyllary began moving from
  Bash to stdlib-only Python 3.11+ behind the existing public command. Compatibility was judged at
  the public CLI contract and command boundary, not by retaining shell internals.
- 2026-07-11: design pause before dotfiles cutover clarified the boundary contract: Phyllary's durable
  asset is the CLI facade over primitives, not a permanent bespoke substrate; Bash is the v0
  implementation, not the language contract; Umbel bundles consume Phyllary and own only operating
  prose/hook wiring, while Phyllary/repo state owns `.phyllary`, claims, worktrees, PR reconciliation, and
  transcript watermarks.
- 2026-07-06: operational-contracts bullet added (exit-code taxonomy, `doctor`-as-health-check,
  mutation-self-verify, non-TTY/`NO_COLOR` output discipline). Surfaced by the small-model delivery
  experiment on unit dotfiles-dft.1 — a fable baseline and a sonnet-implement/haiku-verify arm both
  passed all seven acceptance criteria and shellcheck, yet diverged on `doctor`'s exit code
  (health-check `1` vs always-`0`) and one shipped a `doctor --fix` that printed success over a
  failed write. When two competent implementations of one spec diverge on a load-bearing behaviour,
  the spec underspecified a *contract* — so it is written down here rather than left to per-unit
  criteria (which cannot enumerate every failure path). The neutral referee confirmed both
  behaviours; the cost/quality data and the resulting model-tier policy live in the epic
  dotfiles-dft experiment note.
- 2026-07-07: taxonomy extended with exit `5` (a backend command failed, or a mutation could not be
  confirmed) and not-found folded into `2` (a non-existent id is a bad-id usage error, like a
  missing one). Surfaced delivering unit dotfiles-dft.2 (the inbox verbs are the first to invoke
  `bd`/`gh`): the review caught backend failures returning `1`, which collides with `doctor`'s `1`.
  Same contracts-not-instances move as the row above — decided once here, not per verb.
- 2026-07-09: taxonomy extended with exit `6` for delivery-gate proof failures. The command and
  environment are valid in this case, so folding red proof classes into usage error `2` would erase
  the signal later automation needs to distinguish "invoke phyllary differently" from "delivery is not
  mergeable yet" (ADR 0016 dotfiles-dft.4 amendment).
